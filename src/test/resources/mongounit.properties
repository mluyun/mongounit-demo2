#mongounit.base-uri = mongodb://localhost:27017/test-persondb
#mongounit.drop-database : false
#mongounit.local-time-zone-id = UTC-4


# Possible Properties And Their Defaults:

# mongounit.base-uri = mongodb://localhost:27017/mongounit-testdb
#
# If the user does not specify the `base-uri`, the default of
# mongodb://localhost:27017/mongounit-testdb is used. This URI is only used "as is" if the
# `mongounit.base-uri.keep-as-is` is set to true. Otherwise, the database name is changed with a
# one-time pad which consists of the username of the user executing the tests, followed by a
# date/time stamp, followed by a hash of a UUID.

# mongounit.drop-database : true
#
# By default (true), at the end of the test suite execution, drops the database, so there is no need
# manual cleanup.


# DANGER! DANGER! :-)
# Setting the following property to true will wipe the database pointed to by the value of the
# 'mongounit.base-uri' property. BE SURE that it's not pointing to real data!!!
#
# mongounit.base-uri.keep-as-is = false
#
# By default (false) to make the DB URI unique per execution, appends one-time pad to the database
# name specified in the URI of the `mongounit.base-uri` which consists of the username of the user
# executing the tests, followed by a date/time stamp, followed by a hash of a random number.
# If set to true, the URI specified in `mongounit.base-uri` will be used as is (without a
# one-time pad).

# mongounit.indicator-field-name = $$
#
# By default ($$) is the field name in a mongo document that indicates the document to
# which that field name belongs is not a regular document, but a special MongoUnit framework
# specification of either what BSON type a value is or what comparator to use when asserting a
# match. If the **real** data contains a field name that is named `$$`, this property
# allows the user to change the indicator to some other name that does **not** appear in the real
# data.
# If the dataset file is used solely for assertion, the BSON type can be omitted, i.e., "$$": 234.
# If the "comparator" is missing, it is assumed to have the value of "=".
#
# Supported BSON type strings you can specify:
#
# In a seeding file, the format would be:
# "dateOfBirth": {
#  "$$DATE_TIME": "2019-10-11 17:33:16.201Z"
# }
#
# In assertion file, the format would be:
# "dateOfBirth": {
#  "$$DATE_TIME": "2019-10-11 17:33:16.201Z"
#  "comparator": ">",
# }
#
# Supported "comparator" values are "=", "!=", ">", "<", ">=", "<=".
#
# Supported "bsonType" string values:
#  "ARRAY"
#  "DOCUMENT"
#  "DOUBLE"
#  "STRING"
#  "BINARY"
#  "OBJECT_ID"
#  "BOOLEAN"
#  "DATE_TIME"
#  "NULL"
#  "UNDEFINED"
#  "REGULAR_EXPRESSION"
#  "DB_POINTER"
#  "JAVASCRIPT"
#  "SYMBOL"
#  "JAVASCRIPT_WITH_SCOPE"
#  "INT32"
#  "TIMESTAMP"
#  "INT64"
#  "DECIMAL128"

# mongounit.local-time-zone-id = UTC-4
#
# Specifies the local time zone. This is helpful for the logs because, by default, one of the
# things the MongoUnit framework pads the database name with is date/time. Providing the local
# time zone ID enables the MongoUnit framework to use that instead of the default UTC.
# For valid values for this field, please see the JavaDoc of ZoneId class. (As an example, Eastern
# Standard Time or EST can be expressed as UTC-4).
